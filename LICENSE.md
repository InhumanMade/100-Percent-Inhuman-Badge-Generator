# CC2r: Collective Commitment to Reuse 

The Collective Commitment to Reuse (CC2r) sets out to foster decolonial trans*feminist practices of reuse.

Reuse can include (but is not limited to) getting inspiration from, quoting, attributing or referring to, making copies or a derivative work of, adapting, modifying, reperforming, making available, redistributing existing or collectively developed cultural practices.

CC2r is a commitment to: (i) building and supporting a practice of interdependency and solidarity by cultivating a collective ground from which to commit and act; (ii) sharing and reusing generously and continuously; (iii) refraining from sharing and reusing when it would mean harmful extraction.
