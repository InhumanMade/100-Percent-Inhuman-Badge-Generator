# 100-Percent-Inhuman-Badge-Generator

This work is not ‘100% human made’ – it is 100% inhuman made.

By using this badge, I affirm that this work was created not through a spark of
individual human genius born of authentic lived experience – a claim to originality
that, from a decolonial trans*feminist perspective, has been likened to a form of
settler colonial violence – but through entangled, collective means.

Like all creative work, it has emerged from a deeply rooted assemblage of human
and nonhuman forces: bodies and minds, texts and tools, machines and
technologies, institutions and infrastructures, software code and server farms,
climate systems and digital networks, and, yes, on occasion, AI.

These 100% Inhuman Made badges call on us to reconsider what we mean by 'the human' and how it relates to the world – especially in the context of the climate crisis and rapid expansion of AI. Use them on your books, artworks, newsletters, podcasts or websites to
take a stand against outdated, anthropocentric myths of authorship and originality.
However well-intentioned, such ideas continue to prop up extractive, human-exceptionalist worldviews that fuel social and environmental harm. Signal your
commitment to messy, collective, inhuman creativity – and to worldmaking beyond
capitalist and colonial domination. Put them on your About page, your credits, your
masthead: anywhere you’d normally pretend you made it all by yourself.
